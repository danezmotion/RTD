Data mining is the process of using advanced analytical techniques to extract useful and actionable information from large datasets.
It is often used to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in data that may not be immediately apparent.
In the field of natural killer (NK) cells, data mining can be used to analyze large datasets of genetic and functional information to
identify new insights into the biology of these cells and to identify potential therapeutic targets.

NK cells are a type of immune cell that plays a critical role in the body's defense against infections and cancer.
They are known for their ability to recognize and kill infected or cancerous cells without the need for prior activation. However,
the biology of NK cells is complex and not fully understood, and there is still much to be learned about how these cells function and
how they can be harnessed for therapeutic purposes.

Codondex is combing DNA sequencing algorithms and data mining to harness NK cells and help fight cancer.
DNA sequencing algorithms are computational tools that are used to analyze DNA sequences and identify specific genetic variations or
mutations. DNA sequencing is a process that involves determining the order of the four nucleotide bases (adenine, guanine, cytosine,
and thymine) in a DNA molecule. This information is critical for understanding the genetic makeup of an individual or organism and
can be used for a wide range of applications, including medical diagnosis, genetic testing, and forensic analysis. These algorithms
are designed to analyz large amounts of DNA data efficiently and accurately. They use a variety of techniques, including machine learning
and statistical analysis, to identify genetic variations and mutations that may be associated with certain diseases or traits. Plus,
they can be used to predict the likelihood of an individual developing a particular condition based on their genetic profile.

In this project, I was task to create a visual representation of these algorithms at work. I used SideFX Houdini and Redshift to
develop the final result. And, with the help of the talented team of BLACKBIRD VFX, we created this spot to explain the full process.
