While I was learning Houdini, one of my first experiments with FLIP sims was to create a crown splash.</br>
At the time I was also transitioning from Cinema 4D to Houdini and it was very important to learn how to use Redshift in Houdini for a full transition.</br>
Therefore, using the same sim I created 3 different scenes to experiment with different materials and shaders.
