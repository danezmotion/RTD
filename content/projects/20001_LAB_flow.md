<div class="page_text">

This project was research and development for a couple of shots for the project "Jamaphone".</br>
I was looking for ways to animate particles that leave a trail and that didn't collide with each other.</br>
In this particular case they are looking for an end goal while avoiding existing splines. Furthermore,</br>
I wanted the particles to trigger an event at the born and goal positions represented as a wave in this case.
