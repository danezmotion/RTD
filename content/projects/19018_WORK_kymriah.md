CAR-T cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that uses genetically modified T cells to treat certain types of cancer.</br>
CAR stands for "chimeric antigen receptor", which is a synthetic receptor that is added to the T cells in the laboratory.

The CAR receptor is designed to recognize a specific protein (antigen) on the surface of cancer cells. Once the CAR-T cells are infused into the patient's
bloodstream, they seek out and bind to the cancer cells that express the antigen on their surface. This binding triggers the CAR-T cells to attack and destroy the cancer cells.

CAR-T cell therapy has shown promising results in treating certain types of blood cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma. However, it is a relatively new
treatment and there are still some challenges associated with its use, such as side effects and high costs. Ongoing research is focused on optimizing CAR-T
cell therapy and expanding its use to other types of cancer.

VML Australia approached me to create a visual repreentation of the CAR-T cell.
